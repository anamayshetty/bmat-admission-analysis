# bmat-admission-analysis
This folder currently contains two projects:

1. A short Bayesian project based off McElreath's SR2 to predict admission to Cambridge colleges based on BMAT score. It runs through what an ideal workflow would be, starting off with data visualisation, framing of the questions, assembling of the model and defining terms, prior predictive simulation, model fitting and post predictive simulation. We will also discuss appropriate benchmarks and the benefits of Bayesian modelling.

2. A more general project based on a simplified version of the above dataset. This talks about predication more generally, and the role of statistics in prediction, vs its role in inference. Whilst these are treated as the same, I want to demonstrate their differences, and offer the non-statistian a general background to why we should use statistics.
